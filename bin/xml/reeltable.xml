<!--   

	Issues -
	 
	No Bar on reel 3 ( code 6 ) - therefore you cannot win 3 x bars
	No Bell ( big win ) ( code 5 ) on reel 1 ( 0,5,8 )
	
	Return too high - probably because all permutations are tested ?
	
	No support for dual type symbols.
	
	Should Dual type symbols -
	a) - have their own ID type? YES - in combination with (c)
	b) - be a symbol be created with 2 IDs ( no - causes complications with symbol types - detection etc - Possible Yes )
	c) - a new win combination be created in the probability and return xml
	 ( so 1,1,8 and 7,7,8 would be like either melon, melon, melon, or bar, bar, bar - as the 8 would be a ( melon and bar symbol in one symbol ) )
